``stepdad``'s purpose is to be able to round up and bring order to those many standalone python modules that maybe you
wrote or found on the web at some point and have kept a copy (or copies) ever since. 

Given just a single python file (module), ``stepdad`` will create an appropriate ``setup.py`` and other files if necessary.
All metadata is carefully tracked so that when it comes time to upgrade you just ...upgrade like you would any other
python module or package.
